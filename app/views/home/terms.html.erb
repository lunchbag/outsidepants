<br><br>
<b>What information may we collect, and how would we use it?</b>
OSL may collect information about users in various ways, including by your voluntary submissions, participation in and access to Website, the App and/or the Services, as well as through cookies or other tracking technologies.  The information OSL collects, if any, may be used in a variety of ways, including for internal review, to improve the Website, the App or the Services, to notify you about updates or promotions, or to fulfill and provide the Services.  The information we currently collect may include, but is not limited to, the following:
<br><br>
<b>Non-Personal Data</b>
For purposes of this Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, “Non-Personal Data” means information that does not directly identify you, including “aggregate” and “de-personalized” information, which is data OSL may collect about your use of the Website, the App and/or the Services, from which any personally identifiable data has been removed.
<br><br>
OSL may use tools or third party analytical software to automatically collect and use certain Non-Personal Data that does not directly enable OSL or others to identify you.  The types of Non-Personal Data OSL may collect and use include, but are not limited to: (i) device properties, including, but not limited, to unique device identifier or other device identifier; (ii) device software platform and firmware; (iii) mobile phone carrier; (iv) geographical data such as zip code, area code and location; and (v) other Non-Personal Data to help us enhance the Website, the App and/or the Services.
<br><br>
<b>Aggregate Information</b>
From time to time, OSL may collect general, non-personal, statistical information about the use of Website, the App and/or the Services, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on our Website or in our App, how long they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks/buttons, if any, they click on.  This information represents a generic overview of users, including their collective viewing habits, and allows OSL and/or third parties to modify information, promotions, offers and/or discounts on products and services based on user traffic and behavior.  OSL collects this information through the use of technologies such as ‘cookies’, which are discussed in greater detail below.  OSL may collect this information in order to determine which Services are most popular and to enhance the Services.  OSL may also group this information into aggregate visitor data in order to describe the use of the Services to existing or potential business partners or other third parties, or in response to a government request.  From time to time, OSL may use this Non-Personal Data to optimize third party offers of products and/or services.  OSL may also share aggregated demographic and preference data with third parties to enable the provision of targeted information, promotions, offers and/or discounts on products and services.  However, please be assured that this aggregate data will in no way personally identify you.
<br><br>
<b>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</b>
OSL may automatically collect Non-Personal Data through the use of ‘cookies’. Cookies are small files that a website uses to recognize repeat users, facilitate the user’s ongoing access to the website and facilitate the use of the website.  Cookies also allow a website to track usage behavior and compile website usage information that may allow for the improvement of content and target advertising.  Most browsers allow the user to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.  You may set your browser to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser.  However, please be aware that some features of the Website, the App and/or the Services may not function or may be slower if you refuse cookies.  You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers or other third parties; we do not control these cookies.
<br><br>
Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating system types; clickstream patterns; and dates and times that our Services are accessed.  An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web.  Web servers, the computers that ‘serve up’ webpages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address.  We may link the information we record using tracking technologies to Personal Information we collect from you for our own marketing and advertising purposes.  In addition, we reserve the right to use IP addresses and other tracking technologies to identify a visitor when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, to protect the Website, the App and/or the Services, to protect our customers or third parties, or when we believe that the law requires it.
<br><br>
You recognize and agree that the analytics companies that may be used by OSL may combine the information collected by OSL with other information they have independently collected from other services or products relating to your activities.  These companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies and OSL is not responsible for the acts of these companies.
<br><br>
<b>Personal Information</b>
“Personal Information” refers to information that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name, phone number, email address, postal address, and possibly information relating to certain support or customer service issues or other information.  In some cases, we may need this information to provide the Services to you.  We may use this Personal Information to manage and provide the Services, to monitor user activity, or to otherwise improve the Website, the App or the Services.  We do not currently ask for or collect Personal Information, but we may ask for and/or collect Personal Information in the future.
<br><br>
<b>With whom may we share your personal information?</b>
If we do receive, maintain or use your Personal Information, we will not share your Personal Information with third parties unless one or more of the following conditions is true:
	•	We have your permission to make the disclosure;
	•	The disclosure is consistent with the purpose for which the Personal Information was obtained;

	•	The Personal Information to be disclosed is publicly available;
	•	The disclosure is reasonably related to the sale or other disposition of all or part of our business or assets;

	•	The party to whom the disclosure is made controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with OSL;
	•	The disclosure is, in our sole discretion, necessary for the establishment or maintenance of legal claims or legal compliance, to satisfy any law, regulation, subpoena or government request, or in connection with litigation;
	•	The disclosure is, in our sole discretion, about users who we believe are engaged in illegal activities or are otherwise in violation of our Terms of Use, even without a subpoena, warrant or court order; or
	•	The disclosure is to outside businesses to perform certain services for us, such as maintaining our Services, providing marketing assistance, and data analysis.
<br><br>
Before we share your Personal Information with outside parties, OSL will make agreements with such outside parties.  If OSL becomes aware that any such outside party is improperly using or disclosing Personal Information, including without limitation in breach of any agreement, OSL will notify that outside party and request that it take reasonable steps to cease such use or disclosure.
<br><br>
<b>Choice: Opt-In/Opt-Out</b>
At any time, you can ask us whether we are keeping information about you; how your information is being used; update or delete your information; or opt out of the collection and use of certain information by sending an email or by writing to us specifying the nature and scope of your request.  If you choose to delete any of your Personal Information, or to opt out of the collection and use of your Personal Information, you understand that you may no longer be able to access or otherwise use the Website, the App and/or the Services.  Please state in your correspondence the details of your request.  We may require proof of your identity before we provide you with any requested information or undertake any action in response to a request.  We allow you to challenge the information or data that we hold about you and, where appropriate, you may have the information or data erased, rectified, amended or completed.  Once a request is approved by us, it will be processed within ten (10) days.
<br><br>
<b>Email</b>
As part of the Services provided to you, we may send you email with news or other information.  You may, at any time, opt out of receiving these types of emails from us; however, you agree that we may continue to use your email address from time to time to contact you about your account.
<br><br>
<b>Data Security</b>
The Personal Information you provide and we collect is stored within databases that we control either directly or through our service providers.  As we deem appropriate, we use security measures consistent with industry standards, such as firewalls, to protect your Personal Information, if any.  However, since no security system is impenetrable, we cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.  In the unlikely event of a data breach, we will notify you in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay; however, notification may be delayed if a law enforcement agency determines that the notification will impede a criminal investigation, or to undertake any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.  If we discover that any of your Personal Information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person, we will notify you immediately following the discovery.
<br><br>
Your information may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, or country where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those where you live.  If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, please be aware that we transfer Personal Information to the United States and process and store it here.  By submitting your Personal Information, you consent to having your Personal Information transferred to, processed and stored in the United States.  If we, in our sole discretion, opt to no longer retain your Personal Information, we will take all reasonable steps to dispose, or arrange for the disposal, of your Personal Information.
<br><br>
<b>Links to Other Sites</b>
Our Services may contain hyperlinks and pointers to Internet sites maintained by third parties.  These links are provided for your reference only.  We do not control, operate or endorse in any respect information, products or services on such third party sites and are not responsible for their content.  Many third party sites have their own privacy policies that may differ from ours.  This Terms of Use and Privacy Policy covers only the Website, the App and the Services, and does not cover any other website or service.  While we make every effort to keep your information secure, we do not control the policies of other websites or service providers.
<br><br>
<b>Children’s Privacy</b>
We do not seek or knowingly collect any Personal Information from or about children under 13 years of age.  If we become aware that we have collected Personal Information from or about a child under the age of 13, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database.
